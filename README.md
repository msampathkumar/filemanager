A simple tool to identify exisiting file duplicates and help you do mass file renames updates.

In todays world where we have lots of data, its important to know how data is distrubuted and stored. While the application of this tool can be numerous, we believe this can help you save time and organise data well.

## Problems we want to solve
* Identify all duplicates files
    * mulitple files with same names
    * same files with different names
    * files with same name but different sizes
    * files with **simmilar** name but different sizes
* Clear URL link in filenames or in folders
* Sort Date formats well
    * Year : Files like '2013 checklist.txt' to 'checklist 2013.txt'
    * Bitrate : Files like '1020p what a wonderful world.mp3' to 'What a wonderful world 1020p.mp3'
